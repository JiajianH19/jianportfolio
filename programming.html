                <h1>Word Search</h1>
                <p>Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.</p>
                <p>The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.</p>

                <p>
                    **Let's use the test case above.**<br>

                    First, we store break the String into characters and store it in an array of characters and we will get:<br><br>
                    
                    **[A,B,C,C,E,D]**<br><br>
                    
                    The two for loops will be representing rows and columns. The loop will start at first row, from first item to last item and proceeds to second row items. <br><br>
                    
                    For each of the iteration, a Depth-first-search (DFS) will be performed. <br>
                    
                    **Depth-first-search (DFS)**
                    
                    The dfs() method will accept 5 parameters:

                    <ul>
                        <li>a board with different characters</li>
                        <li>an array of characters</li>
                        <li>integer row number(i)</li>
                        <li>integer column number(j)</li>
                        <li>integer k, which is used to access the items in character array.</li>
                    </ul>

                    The if statement will check if the row and column exceeds the board. It will then check if the character array does contain the character at current position of board[i][j], 
                     false value will be returned if either one of these statements is true.<br><br>

                    Return true if the k value is equals to the length of character array. This means the loop has found all the character specified.<br><br>

                    Mark the current position so it cannot be revisited by setting board[i][j] = '\0' .<br><br>

                    Check the four sides of the current position and return true is either one of the conditions is met.<br><br>

                    Check the four sides of the current position and return true is either one of the conditions is met.<br><br>

                <h1>Adding without Arithmetic operators</h1>
                <img src="Images/sumnoarithmetic.png" style="width: 50vw; height: 60vh;">
                <p>Just a few lines of code, Easy right!<br>But what on earth is going on here</p>
                <p>Lets perform addition on number 1 and 2</p>
                <p>The binary representation of 1 and 2 are
                    0001 and 0010
                </p>
                <p>Peforming an AND operation will give us the
                    number 0000, means there is no carry
                </p>
                <p>Now we will perform a OR operation to get
                    0011
                </p>
                <p>Since there are only 0's in the carry, no carry
                    means the "addition" has completed.
                </p>
                <p>An easy way to approach this question is to
                    think of & AND operation as a way to find the carry
                    , which helps to determine how many iterations
                    should be performed, because after each iteration,
                    the carry will be shifted left by 1 until we are left
                    with 0's.<br>
                    ^ XOR helps us to get the sum of that iteration, we should
                    not worry about the carry because it has been stored and taken cared of
                    from the AND operaiton performed earlier.
