            <h1>Servlet and JSP</h1>
            <p>Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) is a collection of technologies that helps 
                software developers create dynamically generated web pages based on HTML,
                XML, SOAP, or other document types.<br><br>

                **Servlets** are the Java programs that runs on the Java-enabled web 
                server or application server. They are used to handle the request obtained
                from the web server, process the request, produce the response, then send 
                response back to the web server. <br><br>
                
                To better understand servlet, we need to know what is HTTP. <br><br>
                
                **HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**<br>
                
                is a communication between the client and the server.<br><br>
                
                An example would be, when we click on a link, the browser will send a request 
                to the server and the server will responds with a corresponding request.<br>
                
                When Tomcat server received a http request  from client, it will create a request
                object and response object.</p>

                <h3>What is in the request you might ask!</h3>
                <p>
                    A HTTP request consists of<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Request line</li>
                        <li>Headers</li>
                        <li>Empty line</li>
                        <li>Message-body (optional)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Request line</h3>
                <p>Request-Line = Method  Request-URI  HTTP-Version </p>

                <h3>HTTP Request Method</h3>
                <p>In the request, A HTTP Request Method must be specified.<br>

                    There are several request methods such as HEAD, OPTIONS, 
                    DELETE, TRACE, PUT and the most common GET/ POST.</p>

                <h3>GET/ POST</h3>
                <p>For easier understanding, just think of GET and POST as a process of getting 
                    something from the server and sending somthing to the server.</p>

                <h3>Headers</h3>
                <p>The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request,
                     and about the client itself, to the server.</p>

                <h2>Servlet Life Cycle</h2>
                <img src="Images/servletlogic.png" alt="how servlet works" style="width: 100vh; height: 50vh;">
                <ol>
                    <li>Servlet is first initialized by calling the init() method.</li>
                    <li>After being initlialized, all the client's request will all be handled by calling the service() method.</li>
                    <li>Servlet is terminated by calling the destroy() method. An example of this will be terminating the Tomcat server or terminating any unused servlet.</li>
                    <li>init() method will be called to initialize a terminated servlet.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>In this article, instead of implementing Servlet and use the 3 methods mentioned, we will just extends the class of HttpServlet which will come with 2 methods, doGet() and doPost();</p>
 
                <p>Now, let's say we have a servlet called MyServlet and a html page called index.html</p>
                <img src="Images/srv1.jpg" style="width: 100vh; height: 50vh;"><br>
                <img src="Images/jsp1.jpg" style="width: 70vh; height: 30vh;">
                <p>What we are trying to do here is call MyServlet when the submit button is pressed.
                    <br>
                    <h3>But, how does it knows which servlet to call?</h3><br>
                    The answer lies in the web.xml file. ;) <br>

                    The web.xml file can be found under the WEB-INF folder and inside the xml file, 
                    we can decide which servlet to call when certain action happened.<br>

                    <img src="Images/srvmap1.jpg" style="width: 70vh; height: 30vh;">

                    The above code simple links the url-pattern of printHi to the servlet MyServlet.<br><br>
                    So the orders go like this:<br>
                    User clicks on the submit button â†’ certain action will be performed based on the url set â†’ this url will
                    be used to check in the xml file if there is any linked servlet â†’ If there is a linked
                    servlet, the servlet will be called.

                    <h3>Can the servlets store value?ðŸ¤¨</h3>
                    Yes it can, with the help of **ServletConfig** and **ServletContext.**<br>
                    Starting to feel dizzy?ðŸ¥´<br>
                    No worries, let's explore.<br>

                    <h2>ServletConfig</h2>
                    We can store some parameter inside the xml file. <br>
                    Wait what? Why do we have to do so?<br>
                    Let's imagine we have a servlet inside the xml file.   <br><br>
                    <img src="Images/srvconfig1.jpg" style="width: 70vh; height: 20vh;"><br>
                    Woule it be nice if we can store some values in it and just retrieve it to be used in our servlet?<br>
                    By doing so, we can modify the values directly in this xml file ðŸ˜‰.
                    <img src="Images/srvconfig2.jpg" style="width: 70vh; height: 30vh;"><br>
                    Now this servlet will store the my name inside the xml file and can be used anywhere in the servlet.<br><br>
                    To use it in servlet, simple type
                    <img src="Images/srvconfig3.jpg" style="width: 70vh; height: 10vh;"><br>
                    This will store the ServletConfig as an object and the name will be stored inside the value variable.
